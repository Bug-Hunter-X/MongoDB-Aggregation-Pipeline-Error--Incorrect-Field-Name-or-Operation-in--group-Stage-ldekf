# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines, specifically within the `$group` stage. The error involves using an incorrect field name or an inappropriate aggregation operation, leading to unexpected results or errors.  The issue is challenging to debug because it might not always produce an explicit error message and may instead return unexpected results.

## Bug Description
The provided JavaScript code snippet showcases an aggregation pipeline designed to group documents, sum a field, sort the results, and limit the output. However, a mistake in the field names or the aggregation operation within the `$group` stage can lead to incorrect totals or unexpected behavior.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully reviewing the field names used in the `$group` stage to ensure they accurately reflect the fields in your MongoDB collection. Furthermore, double-check that the aggregation operation (e.g., `$sum`, `$avg`, `$min`, `$max`) is correctly applied to the desired field and aligns with the intended aggregation logic.
